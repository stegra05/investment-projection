-   **Owner:** The person/role responsible for monitoring and managing
    the risk (Defaulted to 'Assistant' for now).
-   **Status:** The current state of the risk (e.g., Identified,
    Mitigating, Resolved, Closed).

This provides a more structured way to keep track of potential issues as
the project progresses.
