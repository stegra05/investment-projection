# Detailed Risk Register

This register provides a more detailed view of the potential risks identified for the Investment Planning Projection Website project, expanding on the information in the README.

| ID  | Risk Description                               | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                                                              | Contingency Plan                                 | Owner     | Status     |
| :-- | :--------------------------------------------- | :----- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------- |
| R-01| Underestimating Projection Engine Complexity   | High   | Medium     | Break down logic into smaller parts; allocate specific research/learning time[cite: 137]. | Simplify projection model for V1 if necessary[cite: 138]. | Assistant | Identified |
| R-02| Learning Curve for SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL       | Medium | Medium     | Start with simple CRUD; follow tutorials; allocate learning time[cite: 139].      | Seek community help (Stack Overflow, forums)[cite: 140]. | Assistant | Identified |
| R-03| Data Source Limitations (Free APIs)            | Medium | Medium     | Implement caching; monitor usage; design defensively for API errors[cite: 141].    | Use small budget (€10/mo) for paid tier if vital[cite: 142].  | Assistant | Identified |
| R-04| Overall Time Estimation (Solo Dev @ 8hrs/wk) | High   | Medium     | Use task tracking (Trello); Break down tasks; Regularly review progress vs plan[cite: 144]. | Adjust scope (move Must->Should); Extend timeline[cite: 145]. | Assistant | Identified |
| R-05| Backend API Security Flaws (e.g., Injection, Auth Bypass) | High | Medium | Follow security best practices (input validation, ORM use, secure auth); Use HTTPS; Regular dependency checks. [cite: 502, 511, 517, 540] | Perform security testing (manual/automated); Isolate sensitive data if possible. | Assistant | Identified |
| R-06| Frontend Security Flaws (e.g., XSS)          | Medium | Medium | Sanitize user inputs displayed on UI; Use secure libraries/framework features. [cite: 517] | Implement Content Security Policy (CSP); Perform frontend security testing. | Assistant | Identified |
| R-07| Free Tier Hosting Limitations Exceeded         | Medium | Low        | Monitor resource usage; Optimize application; Choose platform with clear upgrade path. [cite: 890] | Allocate budget (€10/mo) for upgrade if necessary. [cite: 84] | Assistant | Identified |
| R-08| Difficulty Integrating Frontend and Backend    | Medium | Medium     | Define clear API contracts early; Test integration points incrementally. [cite: 757] | Allocate extra time for debugging integration issues. | Assistant | Identified |

* **Owner:** The person/role responsible for monitoring and managing the risk (Defaulted to 'Assistant' for now).
* **Status:** The current state of the risk (e.g., Identified, Mitigating, Resolved, Closed).

This provides a more structured way to keep track of potential issues as the project progresses.
