# Implementation Plan for User Stories

This document outlines the plan for implementing features based on the provided user stories.

---

## User Story 1: Show/Hide Password Visibility

**Goal:** Allow users to toggle the visibility of the password they are typing in password fields.

**Research & Guidelines:**
*   This is a common usability feature, enhancing accessibility and reducing typing errors.
*   Implement using a button/icon (typically an eye/eye-slash icon) adjacent to the password input.
*   Clicking the button toggles the input field's `type` attribute between `password` and `text`.
*   Ensure the toggle clearly indicates the current state (visible/hidden).
*   Consider accessibility: use appropriate ARIA attributes if necessary and ensure the button is focusable and keyboard-operable.
*   Source: General web accessibility guidelines (WCAG), common UI patterns.

**Project Fit:** Applies to password fields on both login and registration forms.

**Implementation Steps (Max 5):**
1.  **HTML:** Add a `button` or icon element (e.g., `<span>` with an icon font or SVG) next to each password `input` in relevant files (e.g., `login.html`, `register.html`).
2.  **CSS:** Style the button/icon for appropriate positioning, appearance, and interaction feedback (e.g., `styles.css`).
3.  **JavaScript (Event Listener):** Add a click event listener to the new button/icon (e.g., in `script.js`).
4.  **JavaScript (Toggle Logic):** In the event listener, get the associated password input field. Check its current `type`: if `password`, change to `text` and update the icon (e.g., to eye-slash); if `text`, change to `password` and update the icon (e.g., to eye).
5.  **Accessibility:** Ensure the button has a clear label (e.g., using `aria-label="Show password"`) that updates dynamically.

## User Story 2: Live Password Strength Feedback

**Goal:** Provide users with real-time feedback on the strength of their chosen password during registration.

**Research & Guidelines:**
*   Helps users create stronger, more secure passwords.
*   Feedback can include a strength meter (bar), textual description (Weak, Medium, Strong), and specific suggestions (e.g., "Add numbers").
*   Use a library like `zxcvbn` for robust strength estimation or implement custom logic based on length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and optionally dictionary checks.
*   Update feedback dynamically as the user types (`oninput` event).
*   Source: Security best practices, UI/UX design patterns for registration forms.

**Project Fit:** Applies specifically to the password input field on the registration form.

**Implementation Steps (Max 5):**
1.  **HTML:** Add an element below the registration password input (e.g., a `div` with a nested progress bar or text area) in `register.html` to display the feedback.
2.  **JavaScript (Library/Logic):** Integrate a strength estimation library (like `zxcvbn`) or define custom strength-checking functions in `script.js`.
3.  **JavaScript (Event Listener):** Attach an `input` event listener to the registration password field in `script.js`.
4.  **JavaScript (Update Feedback):** Inside the listener, pass the current password value to the strength estimator. Update the feedback element (text, progress bar style/value) based on the result.
5.  **CSS:** Style the feedback element (meter colors, text styles) in `styles.css` to clearly communicate strength levels.

## User Story 3: Confirm Password Field

**Goal:** Ensure users don't mistype their password during registration by requiring them to enter it twice.

**Research & Guidelines:**
*   Standard practice for registration forms to prevent account lockouts due to typos.
*   Requires an additional password input field ("Confirm Password").
*   Validation should check if the values in both fields match.
*   Provide immediate feedback (e.g., on `input` or `blur`) if the fields don't match.
*   Prevent form submission if passwords don't match.
*   Source: Common web form design patterns.

**Project Fit:** Applies specifically to the registration form.

**Implementation Steps (Max 5):**
1.  **HTML:** Add a second password input field (`<input type="password">`) labeled "Confirm Password" below the primary password field in `register.html`. Add an element for error messages nearby.
2.  **JavaScript (Event Listeners):** Add `input` event listeners to both the original password and the confirmation password fields in `script.js`.
3.  **JavaScript (Validation Logic):** In the listeners, compare the `.value` of both fields.
4.  **JavaScript (Feedback):** If values don't match, display an error message (e.g., "Passwords do not match") in the designated error element and potentially disable the submit button. If they match, clear the error message and enable the submit button (if it was disabled).
5.  **JavaScript (Form Submission):** Add a final check within the form's `submit` event handler to prevent submission if the passwords do not match, even if JavaScript is partially disabled or bypassed.

## User Story 4: Input Field Hints

**Goal:** Provide guidance to users on what information is expected in form fields.

**Research & Guidelines:**
*   Improves usability and reduces user confusion.
*   Use the `placeholder` attribute for short, simple hints (e.g., "your@email.com").
*   For more complex requirements (e.g., password rules) or formatting examples, use visible helper text below or near the input field.
*   Ensure hints don't disappear on input focus if they contain critical information (use helper text instead of placeholder in that case).
*   Accessibility: Use `aria-describedby` to link inputs to their helper text elements.
*   Source: WCAG, UI/UX form design principles.

**Project Fit:** Applicable to various fields across both login (`login.html`) and registration (`register.html`) forms.

**Implementation Steps (Max 5):**
1.  **Identify Fields:** Review fields in `login.html` and `register.html` that would benefit from hints (e.g., email format, username rules, password requirements).
2.  **HTML (Placeholders):** For simple examples, add `placeholder="..."` attributes directly to the `input` elements.
3.  **HTML (Helper Text):** For more complex hints or requirements, add a `<small>`, `<span>`, or `<div>` element near the relevant input, containing the hint text. Give this element an `id`.
4.  **Accessibility (Linking):** Add `aria-describedby="hint-element-id"` to the corresponding `input` element, linking it to the helper text element created in step 3.
5.  **CSS:** Style the helper text elements (`styles.css`) for clarity and appropriate visual hierarchy (e.g., smaller font size, muted color).

## User Story 5: Login/Registration Feedback

**Goal:** Clearly inform the user about the outcome (success or failure) of their login or registration attempt.

**Research & Guidelines:**
*   Essential for user experience; avoids ambiguity.
*   Feedback should occur after form submission and processing by the server.
*   **Success:** Typically involves redirecting the user (e.g., to their dashboard) or displaying a clear success message.
*   **Failure:** Display specific, actionable error messages (e.g., "Invalid username or password," "Email address already registered"). Avoid generic "Login failed." Place errors near the relevant fields if possible, or in a prominent area above the form.
*   Clear error messages when the user corrects the input.
*   Source: UI/UX principles for form feedback and error handling.

**Project Fit:** Involves client-side handling (`script.js`) of server responses for both login (`login.html`) and registration (`register.html`) forms. Requires backend logic changes to provide specific error codes/messages.

**Implementation Steps (Max 5):**
1.  **HTML:** Add designated areas in `login.html` and `register.html` (e.g., a `div` above the form) to display general success/error messages. Ensure elements for field-specific errors exist (potentially created in previous steps).
2.  **JavaScript (Form Submission):** Intercept the default form submission. Use `fetch` or a similar method in `script.js` to send form data to the backend API endpoint.
3.  **Backend:** Modify backend endpoints (e.g., `/login`, `/register`) to return distinct responses/status codes/JSON messages for success and different types of failures (invalid credentials, email exists, server error, etc.).
4.  **JavaScript (Handle Response):** In the `.then()` or `.catch()` of the `fetch` call:
    *   On success: Redirect the user or display a success message in the designated HTML area.
    *   On failure: Parse the error response from the server. Display the specific error message(s) in the appropriate general or field-specific error areas.
5.  **JavaScript (Clear Errors):** Add logic (e.g., on input focus or change) to clear relevant error messages when the user starts correcting their input. Style error messages clearly in `styles.css`.
